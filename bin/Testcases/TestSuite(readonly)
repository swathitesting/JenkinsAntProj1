/* If we would like to batch run the Tests we do it by using testng.xml file.
   In testng.xml file we specify the class nmaes of the tests in which order we want the tests to be executed 
   serially one after the other.Here in the tetng.xml file we should include all the testcases of the project that we would
   like to execute.
   copy the testng.xml file into the current project it will be copied in the test-output folder.


// refer to the testng.xml file in test-output folder

// Running and exeuting testng.xml :  right click on the testng.xml file select run as Testng Suite.This executes all 
   the testcases included in the testng.xml file srially one after the other.
   
// We can Refer  to test ng default reports generated in test-output folder as well.

// all info regarding each n every test in the suite is generated in the reports.
 // This is a TestSuite file having multiple tests and in which all the tests in the file run serially one after other
 
 
 
 /* In testng.xml file all the tests can also be called parallely for parallel testing. ie namely ApplicationTest
                                                                                          LoginTest_ParametersieTests
                                                                                          RegTest 
     
     All tthe 3 tests are involked parallely  but when LoginTest_ParametersieTests is invoked the all the data sests are
     invoked serially one after the other.                                                                                       
     Becaz the  DataProvider in the LoginTest_ParametersieTests class, will send all the 3 datasets  to  the 
     testcase doLoginTest one after the other serially. but if we want the 3 datasets to be executed paralely as well
     then TestNG testng.xml file with( parallel= tests )only could not achieve this.
     
     Then in @DataProvider we give as below
     @DataProvider(parallel = true) in  LoginTest_ParametersieTests.java file
     
     With parallel = tests as an attribute in testng.xml file we have all the mentioned tests being executed parallely
     But only the 3 datasets of the LoginTest_ParametersieTests being executed serially.
     
     Therefore With  @DataProvider(parallel = true) and also (parallel= tests) in testNG.xml both included 
     we have all the datasets aslo being executed parallely along with the tests that are mentioned in testNG.xml file
     also being executed parallely.
